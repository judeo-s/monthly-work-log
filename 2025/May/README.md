## üóìÔ∏è 2025-05: May Progress Report (ALX Backend Prodev & Cloud Practitioner Prep)

Welcome to my May Brag List! This month has been an intense dive into core backend concepts **and** a significant push into cloud fundamentals. I've been focused on database mastery, making my Python code more robust and efficient, and building a strong understanding of AWS cloud services.

### ‚úÖ Summary of Work

This month, I really pushed into advanced data management, Python engineering principles, and cloud computing. I:

* **ALX Backend Prodev:**
    * **Database Operations:** Spent significant time crafting and optimizing complex SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation.
    * **Performance Tuning:** Explored and implemented database indexing strategies to boost query speeds.
    * **Python Enhancements:** Got hands-on with advanced Python features like `generators` for memory-efficient iteration and `context managers` for resource handling.
    * **Code Structure:** Designed and implemented `custom decorators` to add reusable functionality to my Python functions, such as connection handling, transactions, and retries.
    * **Concurrency:** Dived into `asynchronous programming` using `asyncio` and `aiosqlite` for non-blocking I/O operations, making my backend more responsive.
    * **Project Work:** Applied these learnings to various ALX backend assignments, ensuring robust and efficient code delivery.

* **Cloud Practitioner Certification Prep:**
    * Dedicated substantial time to building foundational knowledge for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.
    * **Module 2: Cloud Economics and Billing:** Covered fundamentals of pricing, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), AWS Organizations, AWS Billing Dashboard, and Technical Support Models.
    * **Module 3: AWS Global Infrastructure Overview:** Gained a solid understanding of AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and service distribution.
    * **Module 4: AWS Cloud Security:** Deep dived into the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management), securing new AWS accounts, data security, and compliance.
    * **Module 5: Networking and Content Delivery:** Explored networking basics, Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) components (networking, security, wizard demo), Route 53, and CloudFront.
    * **Module 6: Compute:** Studied core compute services including Amazon EC2 (instances, pricing, optimization), Container Services, AWS Lambda, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
    * **Module 7: Storage:** Covered essential storage services like AWS EBS, AWS S3, AWS EFS, and AWS S3 Glacier with console demonstrations.
    * Actively completed Knowledge Checks and reviewed Student Guides for all modules.

### üèÜ Achievements

I'm proud of several key wins this month:

* **SQL Query Optimization:** Successfully optimized a particularly challenging query, reducing its execution time by over **50%** through strategic indexing.
* **Decorator Suite:** Developed a reusable suite of Python decorators (`@with_db_connection`, `@transactional`, `@retry_on_failure`) that significantly streamlined database interaction logic across multiple project functions.
* **Async Breakthrough:** Successfully refactored synchronous database calls to asynchronous ones, enabling concurrent fetches without blocking, a major step in building scalable applications.
* **AWS Foundational Understanding:** Gained a comprehensive foundational understanding across core AWS service categories (Compute, Storage, Networking, Security, Billing), crucial for the Cloud Practitioner certification.
* **Consistent Contributions:** Maintained a strong daily contribution streak on GitHub, reflecting consistent effort and problem-solving.

### üî• Failures and Learnings

Not every step was smooth, but every challenge offered a lesson:

* **Async Debugging Hurdles:** Initially struggled with debugging complex `asyncio` call stacks, leading to frustrating `Task was destroyed but it was pending` errors. I learned the critical importance of proper `asyncio.create_task` usage and diligent `await` calls.
* **Transaction Rollbacks:** Encountered unexpected transaction rollbacks due to overlooked constraint violations. This reinforced the need for thorough error handling and pre-validation in database write operations within a transactional context.
* **AWS Service Overload:** Felt overwhelmed initially by the sheer number of AWS services. I learned to focus on their core purpose and relationships, which helped in structuring my study approach.

### üåü Highlights of the Month

* The "aha!" moment when my `retry_on_failure` decorator successfully handled a simulated transient database error, demonstrating real-world resilience.
* Connecting the dots between backend development concepts (like scalability and resilience) and how AWS services directly address these needs.
* Successfully running multiple asynchronous database queries concurrently for the first time, seeing the power of non-blocking I/O in action!
* Completing a significant portion of the Cloud Practitioner curriculum ‚Äì feeling confident in my foundational cloud knowledge.
